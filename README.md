# Catch-Me-If-You-Can-An-Indoor-Localization-Game-Using-BLE-Beacons-and-Android-Phones
"Human Catch Me If You Can" is a BLE-based game that combines indoor localization and multiplayer gameplay.  The game uses BLE beacons to track player positions on a virtual game board, allowing for real-time competition and demonstrating the potential of BLE technology for indoor tracking.

The project is called "Human Catch Me If You Can" and it involves building a game using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and Android phones for indoor localization and multiplayer gameplay. The game includes two modes: one-to-one playing mode and two teams against each other mode.

Players use their smartphones to interact with a virtual game board, moving their character around and collecting points as they travel. Ghosts, who are also players, attempt to catch the other players by determining the best path to intercept them.

The game uses BLE beacons to track the positions of players and ghosts, and a scoring system is implemented to track players' performance. The project also includes signal strength calculations to estimate the players' distances based on the nearby beacons' signal strength.

Overall, the project combines indoor localization technology with a fun and interactive game, demonstrating the potential of BLE technology for indoor tracking and the accuracy of BLE-based indoor localization for a variety of applications.
